### Code from Eloquent JS. Chapter 11. Project: A Programming Language

* [Eloquent JS. Chapter 11. Project: A Programming Language](http://eloquentjavascript.net/11_language.html)
* [Deploy at GitHub](https://ULL-ESIT-PL-1617.github.io/egg) (See branch gh-pages)

### Debugging

* [Debugging Node.js with Chrome DevTools](https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27#.32rn3vkkj) by Paul Irish Jun 24, 2016
* [NodeJS Debugger Documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html)
  - [V8 Inspector Integration for Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html#debugger_v8_inspector_integration_for_node_js)
    - V8 Inspector integration allows attaching Chrome DevTools to Node.js instances for debugging and profiling. NOTE: This is an experimental feature.


### Grammar

```Yacc

expression: STRING 
          | NUMBER 
          | WORD apply 

apply: /* vacio */
     | '(' expression (',' expression)* ')' apply


WHITES: /(\s|#.*)*/
STRING: /"([^"]*)"/
NUMBER: /\d+\b/
WORD:   /[^\s(),"]+/
```

### AST

* Expressions of type "value" represent literal strings or numbers. 
Their value property contains the string or number value that they represent.

* Expressions of type "word" are used for identifiers (names). Such objects have a name property that holds the identifierâ€™s name as a string. 
* Finally, "apply" expressions represent applications. They have an operator property that refers to the expression that is being applied, and an args property that holds an array of argument expressions.

```
ast: VALUE{value: String | Number}
   | WORD{name: String}
   | APPLY{operator: ast, args: [ ast ...]}
```

The >(x, 5) part of the previous program would be represented like this:

```
{
  type: "apply",
  operator: {type: "word", name: ">"},
  args: [
    {type: "word", name: "x"},
    {type: "value", value: 5}
  ]
}
```
